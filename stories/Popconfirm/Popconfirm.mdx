# Popconfirm

  <T k="doc_popconfirm_title" />
</p>

A simple confirmation box that appears when clicking on a target element.

## Usage

Use Popconfirm for simple confirmations that don't require a full modal dialog. It's often used for destructive actions like deletion.

<Canvas of={PopconfirmStories.Default} />

## Properties

<Controls />

## Examples

### With Description

You can add a description to provide more context for the confirmation.

<Canvas of={PopconfirmStories.WithDescription} />

### Disabled

When disabled, the target element will be rendered directly without the popconfirm behavior.

<Canvas of={PopconfirmStories.Disabled} />
