# TabNavigation

TabNavigation provides a set of links to navigate between different views or contexts. Unlike the `Tabs` component, it is primarily designed for page-level navigation or filtering, often modifying the URL.

## Import

```jsx
import TabNavigation from "./TabNavigation";
```

## Basic Usage

The default style is `underline`, commonly used for secondary page navigation.

<Canvas of={TabNavigationStories.Default} />

## Variants

### Pill

Pill tabs are useful for filtering lists or toggling between states without changing the page context significantly.

<Canvas of={TabNavigationStories.Pills} />

### Contained

Contained tabs resemble a segmented control and are often used for changing data views (e.g., charts by time period).

<Canvas of={TabNavigationStories.Contained} />

## With Icons

You can add icons to items using the `icon` prop.

<Canvas of={TabNavigationStories.WithIcons} />

## API Reference
