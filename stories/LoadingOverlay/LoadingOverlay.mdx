# LoadingOverlay

A component that overlays the entire screen or a specific element to display a loading state with customizable loaders, backdrops, and messages.

## When To Use

- When you need to block user interaction during asynchronous operations like data fetching or form submission.
- When you want to provide visual feedback that a process is ongoing.
- When you need a full-screen loading indicator for application initialization.
- When you want to overlay a specific section of the page during partial updates.

## Features

- **Multiple Loader Types**: Choose from spinner, bars, dots, or pulse animations.
- **Customizable Backdrop**: Light or dark backdrop with adjustable blur effects.
- **Flexible Positioning**: Can be positioned absolutely within a container or fixed for full-screen coverage.
- **Optional Message**: Display a loading message to provide context to users.
- **Custom Content**: Replace the default loader with custom content.
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper ARIA attributes for screen readers.

## Examples

### Basic

A simple loading overlay with the default spinner.

<Canvas of={LoadingOverlayStories.Basic} />

### With Message

Display a message along with the loading indicator.

<Canvas of={LoadingOverlayStories.WithMessage} />

### Different Loader Types

Choose from various loader animations: spinner, bars, dots, or pulse.

<Canvas of={LoadingOverlayStories.DifferentLoaderTypes} />

### Backdrop Variants

Light and dark backdrop options for different background colors.

<Canvas of={LoadingOverlayStories.BackdropVariants} />

### Blur Effects

Control the backdrop blur intensity: none, sm, md, or lg.

<Canvas of={LoadingOverlayStories.BlurEffects} />

### Full Screen

Use `fixed={true}` to create a full-screen loading overlay.

<Canvas of={LoadingOverlayStories.FullScreen} />

### Interactive

A practical example showing how to toggle the loading state.

<Canvas of={LoadingOverlayStories.Interactive} />

### Custom Loader

Provide custom content instead of the default loaders.

<Canvas of={LoadingOverlayStories.CustomLoader} />

## Best Practices

- **Use Sparingly**: Only show loading overlays when necessary to avoid disrupting the user experience.
- **Provide Context**: Include a message when the loading operation might take more than a few seconds.
- **Choose Appropriate Scope**: Use absolute positioning for partial page updates and fixed positioning for full-page operations.
- **Consider Backdrop**: Use light backdrops on dark backgrounds and vice versa for better visibility.
- **Timeout Handling**: Always implement timeout handling to prevent indefinite loading states.

## Accessibility

- The component includes `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader announcements.
- The `aria-busy="true"` attribute indicates that the content is loading.
- Ensure that loading messages are descriptive and helpful for users relying on assistive technologies.
